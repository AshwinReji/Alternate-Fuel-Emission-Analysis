# Emission & Efficiency Analysis of Alternative Fuels in CI Engine
This project investigates the emission characteristics and engine performance of various alternative fuel blends, including Waste Cooking Oil (WCO), Waste Plastic Oil (WPO), and Diesel, with and without Hydrogen gas enrichment. The dataset was derived from experimental testing under multiple load conditions and analyzed using both Power BI and SQL (MySQL).

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze pollutant emissions (CO, HC, NOx, Smoke %) for different fuel blends
- Evaluate performance metrics such as Thermal Efficiency, Specific Fuel Consumption, and Net Heat Release Rate
- Compare results with and without hydrogen gas injection
- Showcase SQL and Power BI (DAX) integration for data analysis

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI** (with DAX measures and visuals)
- **MySQL** (views, aggregations, filtering)
- **Excel/CSV** (source data)
- **GitHub** (portfolio)

## 📊 Dashboards

### 📘 Dashboard 1: Excel + Power BI (DAX-Based)

- Developed using Excel data and calculated DAX measures
- Visuals include clustered bar charts, matrix, KPIs, tooltips, and gauge meters
- Focused on emission vs performance across different blends
### 🟦 Dashboard 2: MySQL + Power BI

- SQL views used to summarize and group emissions by blend
- Power BI connected directly to MySQL
- Separate dashboard created using SQL as the backend source
